# JobLeadGenerator
A Python 3.4 app that generates job leads

This app currently scrapes the software job posting in craigslist. 
Once it finds the job listing it presents the job posting in a new tab on your web browser.
It can scrape the posting for job title
    (soon to include company and hiring manager) if acceptable.
It can fill in a pre set cover letter with scraped infomation.
It can save the job info that was provided and will not genereate the same lead multiple times.

Soon to come:
Generating from different sources on craigslist and even other web sites.
Generating job leads from specific key words.
Taking you to the apply online location if present.
auto emailing coverletter and resume to job posting.
filling a google spreadsheet with database information.
